"""Riot exposure from the documented formulas. Used only as a score cost, never as profit.

A Michigan loss starts a riot on High Street (intensity 0.7, radius 260 m); a national title starts
one around the Stadium (0.95, 380 m). A truck that opened d metres away is hit with probability
intensity * exp(-d / radius): wrecked 30% of the time (out the next 2 days), otherwise a repair
bill of 30 + 120 * exp(-d / radius). The forecast warns the night before, but its shape is not
documented, so warnings are read leniently from event text; with no warning the cost is zero.
