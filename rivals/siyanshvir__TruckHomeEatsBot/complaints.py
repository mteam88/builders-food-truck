"""Health complaints against a rival: a rarely used move, filed only when the numbers clearly favor it.

The game's tip line cuts the target's reputation 20% at every spot from the next day. Each complaint can
be caught: with k complaints in the last 3 days (this one included) the catch chance is 10% x k, and a
catch bans us (5 days live; the rest of the market in the final), throws the complaint out and restores
the targets. So the model weighs the gain against catch risk x loss:

    gain  = our extra expected profit tomorrow if the target's reputation were 20% lower, times how long
            the dent lasts (reputation recovers as the target sells)
    loss  = days we would miss x our recent daily profit (more days left, more to lose)
    file  = gain - p_catch * (loss + gain) clears a margin, at most one complaint per 3 days, and only
            against a rival that is likely to share our spot.

Because loss shrinks as the market ends, filing becomes attractive only late. Everything is switchable:
