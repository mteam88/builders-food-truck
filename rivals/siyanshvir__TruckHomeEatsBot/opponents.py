"""Online probabilistic rival forecasts, scored before observing each new result.

A mixture learns which behavior models explain each rival. Contextual historical
neighbors use announced events, forecast crowd shares, and weather probabilities.
Price Wars' documented undercut/cycle behaviors are pricing hypotheses, not rules
