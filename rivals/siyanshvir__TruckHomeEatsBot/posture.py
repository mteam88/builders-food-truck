"""Self-adjusting posture: how much risk and exploration the planner takes, from how the field is doing.

Everything is read from the API each night (every truck's cash). Nothing is set by hand:
- pressure: the fastest rival's recent daily earnings exceed ours. The further behind, the lower the
  weight on expected losses, the more weight on upside variance, and the more a quiet spot we do not
  usually use is worth trying.
- lead: we out-earn every rival. Then risk weight rises and exploration falls, so we protect a home
  spot where our reputation already pays.
All effects are bounded, scale in smoothly as evidence accumulates, and switch off with
NIGHTSHIFT_POSTURE=off or data/profile.json {"posture": "off"}.
